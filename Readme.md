This program takes a number between 0 - 9 and returns the word for that number. If the user enters
a number higher or lower than 0 -9 then they will get an error message letting them know that number is not
in the list. It uses a dictionary and takes the number which matches one of the keys in the dictionary and
the value for each number is the word for that number.
